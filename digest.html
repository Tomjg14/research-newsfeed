  Recognition in Conversations?</a><br><small>Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly…</small></li>
<li><a href='http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05473v1'>Embedding Alignment in Code Generation for Audio</a><br><small>LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative
coding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural
motifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users
may benefit from considering multiple varied code…</small></li>
<li><a href='http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05464v1'>Bench-2-CoP: Can We Trust Benchmarking for EU AI Compliance?</a><br><small>The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but…</small></li>
